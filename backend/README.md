Backend Placeholder

This directory is reserved for future backend services.

Guidelines
- Language: Python (per AGENTS.md).
- Add a service-specific README and env example before adding code.
- Do not commit secrets. Use `.env.local` and document required vars.

Suggested Next Steps
- Plan API surface (auth, employee profiles, analytics).
- Define data contracts consumed by the React UI.
